In this project, a large-scale extracellular neural recording data was analysed. 
The project consisted of using variational autoencoder to localize individual spikes. 
Once the localization was achieved, each spikes were clustered based on their waveform shapes and location information. 
At the end, each detected spikes were assigned to its true neuron using micrograph image provided with the data. 
The main contribution of the project was to develop a novel validation method for spike sorting algorithms.  



**A Cloud Based Smart Irrigation System**

Irrigation systems play a key role in order to decrease unnecessary water
 usage around the world. To this end, agriculture professionals developed 
 a pan based irrigation system. In this method, farmers calculate the amount of
 water utilized by the farm and the irrigation is carried out based on this calculation. 
 However, this method involves with calculations with bare eyes on the farm, which are 
 usually far away from the city centre. We developed a smart irrigation system to automate 
 all the tasks by using internet of things (ioT) architectures. You can find the details of 
 the project in this [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8376641) where we present on an international conference in Greece. 
 
 **Automatic Detection of Sea Turtle's Traces from Aerial Images**

This project was carried out in collaboration with WWF. 
The main idea was to develop an automated path following algorithm for an aerial 
image to find the regions in which sea turtles nest. Matlab was used as an environment 
and project consisted of Na√Øve Bayes algorithm.

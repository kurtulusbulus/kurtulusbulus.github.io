It's been nearly four years since I relocated to Edinburgh to embark on my postgraduate journey. It's amazing how time has flown by; I can still vividly recall the anxiety I felt as I prepared to move to this new city and adapt to a different education system. Thankfully, I not only overcame those initial fears but also had the most incredible experiences in one of the world's most beautiful cities.

Now that I've truly become an Edinburgher(!), I felt compelled to share my insights in a blog-like article, especially for newcomers. In this piece, I'll endeavor to guide you on how to settle into Edinburgh, particularly from a student's perspective. However, the advice and tips I offer can certainly benefit anyone coming to this wonderful city for various reasons. My hope is that this article will prove invaluable to new students, especially those international students who are navigating life in the UK for the first time.


## Accomodation

Accommodation is often the primary concern for most students when planning their move to Edinburgh. Unfortunately, it can be a bit of a challenge to find the right place at the outset. However, if you're a new student, there are some advantages you can leverage. The university, for instance, offers priority accommodation to new students, which can be quite beneficial. You can find more details about this priority housing on the following website:

[University of Edinburgh Accommodation Guarantees](https://www.accom.ed.ac.uk/applying/guarantees/)

One valuable resource that I stumbled upon during my time in Edinburgh, which I wish I had known about earlier, is the Domus website: [Domus](https://domus.ed.ac.uk/) - University of Edinburgh Accommodation. Here, you can discover flat-like accommodations near the campus with contracts directly managed by the University of Edinburgh. This can be advantageous because many landlords in the UK require references, which can be challenging for international students without UK-based relatives. Additionally, the university covers utility bills, sparing you the hassle of setting up accounts for electricity, internet, and gas. They also offer special accommodations for students who are married or have children; you can find more information on the website.

Other options to consider include shared flats, private accommodations, or renting a new flat on your own. If you're open to exploring these alternatives, the following websites can be helpful:

Facebook Marketplace
Meadows Facebook Group

These resources should provide you with a variety of housing options to consider for your stay in Edinburgh.

## Campus 

The University of Edinburgh boasts two primary campuses, with additional satellite campuses available. While I won't delve into the specifics of these satellite campuses, you can access detailed information about them here: [University of Edinburgh Campus Map](https://www.ed.ac.uk/maps).

The central campus, situated around Old College, is the primary hub of activity. It houses various schools, including the School of Informatics, the Medical School, and the School of Fine Arts. It's worth noting that this area is sprawling and forms a distributed campus. Additionally, you'll find the main university library here, which is the largest and offers numerous conducive study spaces.

The second significant campus, known as King's Buildings, is situated in the Blackford area. You can easily navigate to the King's Buildings campus from the central campus or other parts of the city. This campus hosts most of the engineering schools, the Departments of Mathematics and Statistics, as well as some of the Biological Sciences Schools. Notably, the university provides free shuttle bus services for students, and you can find their timetables here: [University of Edinburgh Shuttle Bus Timetables](https://www.ed.ac.uk/transport/public-transport/buses/shuttle-bus).

These campuses collectively offer a rich and diverse academic environment for students at the University of Edinburgh.


## Shopping 

When you're embarking on a new life in Edinburgh, you'll inevitably need to make a variety of purchases. While Ikea might come to mind, there's no need to venture quite that far from the main campus. Instead, consider the following options for nearly everything you might require:

Poundsaver: Situated in the central area, Poundsaver is incredibly convenient to access from Old College or the Main Campus. Here, you can find a wide array of items for your kitchen, living room, notebooks, and much more. It's known for being quite affordable, but it's always a good idea to do a price check.

Edinburgh Bargain Store: Also located in the central area, this store is larger than Poundland, and the staff are known for their helpfulness. Pay a visit and explore their wide selection to find whatever you need.

Thrift Shops: While not a specific place, during Welcome Week, there's typically an event where thousands of departing students leave behind useful items. These are collected and made available to new students at lower prices. It's an excellent opportunity to discover essential items at a budget-friendly cost.

When it comes to groceries, you have several options:

Tesco: A nationwide grocery chain that offers affordable prices. You can find fresh vegetables, bread, oils, and a wide variety of foods. Tesco's Meal Deal for a quick lunch is a popular option, allowing you to grab a sandwich, drink, and snack for Â£3.50. This concept is also available at other stores.

Lidl: Known for its affordability and common presence in several countries, Lidl may offer cheaper prices than Tesco for certain products. Their bakery section is a highlight, with freshly baked goodies, including Pasteis de Nata.

Sainsbury's: Another UK-wide grocery chain, Sainsbury's provides a good selection of products. While some items may be a bit pricier for students on a budget, it's still a solid choice.

When it comes to clothing and household items:

TK Maxx: This store offers a diverse range of products for the bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and more. What sets it apart is its clothing section, where you can find designer brands at affordable prices. Don't be surprised to stumble upon a genuine Lacoste t-shirt at a remarkably low price.

Primark: While it may be familiar to some, Primark is known for being very budget-friendly. It's a top choice for students looking for affordable clothing and essentials.

These options should cover most of your needs as you settle into life in Edinburgh.


## Transportation 

Edinburgh is a fantastic city, and its walkability is one of its standout features. As a result, you'll often find that you won't need to rely on underground tubes or extensive transportation networks. Instead, the primary mode of transportation in the city is the bus system. Although there is a tramway, it doesn't cover most of the city, including areas around the campus. However, it can be a convenient option for traveling between the city center and the airport.

The bus services are operated by the Lothian Bus Company, and you can access detailed information about routes and schedules on their website: [Lothian Buses Website](https://www.lothianbuses.com/).

When it comes to payment, you have a couple of options. You can either download their app or pay directly on the bus. If you choose to pay in cash, please ensure that you have the exact fare as cash payments usually require the correct amount. However, the most convenient method is to use your contactless card for payments. Just make sure that your card is activated for international use, as this will simplify your life considerably. Additionally, consider exploring their website for information about monthly passes tailored to students' needs.

Navigating Edinburgh's public transportation system should be relatively straightforward with these options and resources at your disposal.

## Tools

There are several handy tools that you might find beneficial. Let me list them for you:

1. Citymapper App:

This app offers a comprehensive list of available transportation routes. I recommend using Citymapper instead of Google Maps because it provides more up-to-date information. I've personally used it in both London and Edinburgh, and it's proven to be much more reliable than Google Maps for navigating these cities.
2. EUSA App:

Be sure to download the EUSA app, as it offers valuable information about events and simplifies your life when you need to make purchases at university cafes.
3. Skyscanner:

Skyscanner is a fantastic tool for finding affordable flight tickets to a wide range of destinations from Edinburgh and other parts of the UK. You can prepare to explore some of the best European destinations with flights costing as little as Â£9. Don't forget to visit their website to check out the deals.

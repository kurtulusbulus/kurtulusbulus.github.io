I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences, located within The University of Edinburgh. Under the guidance of Prof. Matthew Nolan, Dr. Istvan Gyongy, and Dr. Srinjoy Mitra, my research focuses on the development of ultra-high-speed photometry systems to investigate neural activity. Prior to this, I completed my master's degree at the School of Informatics, where I undertook a diverse range of computational and biological courses.

During my master's dissertation, I utilized machine learning techniques to analyze extracellular neural recordings. Before joining the University of Edinburgh, I worked as a graduate research intern at the University of Aveiro in Portugal during the summer of 2019. In Aveiro, I successfully completed a small project involving machine learning and simulation for smart parking lots.

Between 2017 and 2019, I served as a research/teaching assistant at Adana Science and Technology University. This role provided me with valuable experience in research projects related to machine learning, image processing, and the Internet of Things.

In the long term, my research aspirations revolve around the development of advanced imaging tools that can accelerate experimental biology, with a particular focus on neuroscience. I firmly believe that the integration of engineering methods and computational science holds great promise in enhancing our understanding of the cortex.

Prior to 2017, I co-founded a startup company after securing funding from the Turkish Ministry of Science. The core idea behind the project involved the development of a smart electronic drum system, which is still in progress.

I am honored to be a recipient of the Turkish Ministry of Education Scholarship for graduate study abroad. All of my postgraduate studies and research are generously funded by the Turkish Ministry of Education.

During my leisure time, I enjoy visiting the gym, exploring local coffee shops, and embarking on travel adventures.

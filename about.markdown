I am currently pursuing a postgraduate study at the University of Edinburgh. My current research interests 
are machine learning, image processing, bioinformatics and computational neuroscience.Prior to Edinburgh, 
I was a graduate research intern at University of Aveiro in Portugal. In Aveiro, I involved with a small project, which 
included machine learning and simulation for smart parking lots. 

Between 2017 and 2019, I worked as a research/teaching assistant at Adana Science and Technology University. As a research assistant, 
I involved a couple of research projects related with machine learning, image processing and internet of things. 

Before 2017, I co-founded a start-up company by winning a small capital from Turkish Ministry of Science. The project idea was based 
on development of a smart electronic drum system. The project is still under the development.   

I am also the recipent of Turkish Ministry of Education Scholarship for graduate study abroad.

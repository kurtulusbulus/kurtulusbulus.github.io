I am currently a PhD candidate at Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences within The University of Edinburgh, supervised by Prof. Matthew Nolan, 
Dr. Istvan Gyongy and Dr. Srinjoy Mitra. My PhD project involves the development of ultra-high speed photometry systems to investigate circuit mechanisms of memory consolidation 
in hippocampus. I obtained my master degree from School of Informatics, where a various types of computational and biological courses were involved.
 My master dissertation was using machine learning to analyse extracellular
neural recordings. Prior to Edinburgh, I was a graduate research intern at University of Aveiro in Portugal on summer 2019. Throughout my stay in Aveiro, a small project, which 
included machine learning and simulation for smart parking lots, were accomplished. 

Between 2017 and 2019, I worked as a research/teaching assistant at Adana Science and Technology University. As a research assistant, 
I had a chance to take part in research projects, which are related with machine learning, image processing and internet of things.

In the long term, my research goal is to develop advance tools in order to accelerate experimental biology, especially focus on neuroscience.
 I personally believe that engineering methods along with computational
science are promising to shed light on our understanding of human cortex. 

Before 2017, I co-founded a start-up company by winning a small capital from Turkish Ministry of Science. The project idea was based 
on development of a smart electronic drum system. The project is still under the development.   

I am also the recipent of Turkish Ministry of Education Scholarship for graduate study abroad. My all postgraduate study and research are funded by Turkish Ministry of Education.
